### What I learned

this project helped advance my knowledge of the reactjs and working with reusable components. Additionally, i also learned how to make api calls using axios in a react app. This project helped to advance my knowledge of functional components in reactjs and use of react hooks.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I am looking at doing more projects in the future to help advance my understanding of the react ecosystem.

### Useful resources
